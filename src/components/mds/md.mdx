# Pipeline

![Pipeline of WIPES](./pdf/2.1_pipeline_00.png)

Pipeline of WIPES. WIPES can be seamlessly integrated into various visual reconstruction tasks, including 2D image representation, 5D static and 6D dynamic novel view synthesis (NVS).

# Wavelet-Based Frequency Flexibility

![Wavelet-Based Frequency Flexibility](./pdf/4.3_toy_exp_00.png)

Comparisons of Gaussian and wavelet primitives for representing complex texture patterns. Results indicate that wavelet primitives effectively overcome the low-frequency bias of Gaussian primitives and demonstrate excellent performance in high-frequency texture regions.
